# portfolio-v2

## Portfolio Concept
I'm looking to make a clean looking portfolio site utilizing Three.js. I've been inspired by a few portfolios recently and I feel like I need to make mine stand out a bit more. 

## Tasklist
1. Learn the least amount of Blender needed to make something cool [x]
2. Make something cool [x] 
2. Build website []
3. Add cool Blender thing to website []
4. ???
5. Profit []

## Methodologies Used
1. Singleton design pattern - pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the app, in this case I'm using Experience.js. The singleton design pattern is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one does not exist. If an instance already exists, it simply returns a reference to that object. 

## Technologies/Packages Used
1. Vite - this is the build tool I'll be using for my project. It is fast and lightweight, and focuses on provides really good bundling and has great documentation.
2. Three.js - this is a JavaScript library that lets you create 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for creating and manipulating 3D objects in a 3D scene. 
3. Events - this is a node.js module that allows you to add Event Emitters to you project. These are useful because you can create a new event instance and attach event listeners to it. 

## Commands to get started
1. npm create vite@latest
2. cd "project name"
3. npm i
4. npm run dev
5. npm i three --save-dev
6. npm i events
